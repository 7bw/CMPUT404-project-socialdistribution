## Guide to add a node to your system

1. Find `frontend/src/requests/URL.js`, change

- \_domain (your current domain)
- \_remoteDomain (the domain name of a foreign system)
- \_port (if use localhost, set port to 8000, otherwise leave it empty)
- \_auth (this variable will be put in Authorization Header, so change it to what you need)

2. Change `backend/presentation/Viewsets/URL.py`, change

- domain (your current domain name + port, for example: http://localhost:8000)
- remoteDomain (the domain name of a foreign system)
