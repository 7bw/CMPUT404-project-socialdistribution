FYI: The deployed and master branch versions are connecting with team20, since team4 didn't provide some APIs correctly, for example, they don't have APIs for accepting/declining friend requests, posting comments and likes have some issues until Thursday. We tried to refactor our code and we can have their public posts, see lists of comments and likes. We put the code on a branch called remote, if you want to check, you can just download it locally.
